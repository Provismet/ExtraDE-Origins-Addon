# ExtraDE Origins Addon
This Origins addon allows you to grant an Origin one of the entity groups defined by [Extra Damage Enchantments](https://github.com/Provismet/Extra-Damage-Enchantments).  

## Powers
This mod creates a new power type `extrade:entity_group` that works identically to the standard `origins:entity_group` power type, but with additional options.  
Concrete power implementations are already provided by the mod, to use them add one of these to your origin:
- `extrade:humanoid`
- `extrade:outerworldly`
- `extrade:arcane`
- `extrade:fungifloral`
- `extrade:beastly`
